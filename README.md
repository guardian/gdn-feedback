# Feedback

A simple application to gather feedback and be able to present the feedback in a variety of ways.

It is primarily a managerial tool for understanding who has provided feedback and what feedback is outstanding.

## Running the app

This is a Google Appengine app written in Python and is bound to the Guardian's Google domain instance. If you're using OSX I would recommend just using the Appengine launcher app.

You need to create data locally before you use it.
